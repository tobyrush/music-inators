# music-inators
Javascript framework for creating interactive music widgets in web pages.

This is a version of the Inators functionality built into [Music Theory 21c](https://tobyrush.com/book/), an open-source online music theory textbook by Stefanie Acevedo and Toby W. Rush. For a reference manual, visit the [Interactive Figures](https://tobyrush.com/book/text/dev/inators.html) section in that work's appendix.
